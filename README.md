## About

This Vim config is an attempt to increase my text editing efficiency. It is patterned after Jeffrey Way's setup though I have made a few tweaks and enhancements where I saw fit. 

I added a distraction free writing experience and a few more plugins that I stole from other configs. 

It is an efficient and clean setup.  I will be adding photos soon.
