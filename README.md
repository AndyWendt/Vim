## About

This Vim config is an attempt to increase my text editing efficiency. It is patterned after Jeffrey Way's setup though I have made a few tweaks and enhancements where I saw fit. 

I added a distraction free writing experience and a few more plugins that I stole from other configs. 

It is an efficient and clean setup.  I will be adding photos soon. 

## Prereqs

* GVim or MacVim
* Source Code Pro Font 

## Optional System changes

* swap `esc` with `caps lock`
  * `dconf write /org/gnome/desktop/input-sources/xkb-options "['caps:swapescape']"`
